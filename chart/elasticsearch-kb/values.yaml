  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources,such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources,uncomment the following
  # lines,adjust them as necessary,and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
